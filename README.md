# The PicoPicorder
The Picorder project, redux, on a Raspberry Pi Pico.

This project is based on the idea of the Star Trek "tricorder". It is a labour of love which has taken me through at least 10 versions of the same thing, in various different forms. [See this page for a history of the project](https://www.recantha.co.uk/blog/?cat=37).

The PicoPicorder is the latest iteration and is based on the Raspberry Pi Pico. [A full write-up can be found here](https://www.recantha.co.uk/blog/?page_id=20924).
